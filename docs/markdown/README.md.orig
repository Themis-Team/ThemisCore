@section bugs-and-feature-request Bugs and feature requests

Have a bug or a feature request? Please first read the [issue guidelines](_blank) and search for existing and closed issues. If your problem or idea is not addressed yet, [please open a new issue](https://github.com/PerimeterInstitute/Themis/issues/new).

@section documentation Documentation

Themis' documentation, included in this repo in the docs directory, is built with [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/) and publicly hosted on ... at <http://www.eventhorizontelescope.org/>. The docs may also be run locally.

Additionally, the general features of Themis will be described in the [Themis Code paper](../../publications/ms.pdf) (Under preparation)


@section contributing Contributing

Please contribute!  Themis only works if many people participate in its development.  However, to ensure that Themis continues to be broadly accessible, we do have standards for code structure and documentation that can be found in detail on the [Contributing page](@ref Contribute).
