## About

Themis is a *framework* for performing analyses of the ground-breaking EHT observations that is flexible and extensible.  To read more about the underlying philosophy and goals of Themis, see the About page.


## Quick start

Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Themis-Team/ThemisCore.git'

Read the Getting started page for information on system requirements, configuration, compilation, and getting things running.


## Documentation

Documentation is available online for the [latest release](https://themis-team.github.io/ThemisCore/).  A complete set of html documentation is distributed with Themis, and is automatically generated via [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/).  Documentation standards are described in the Contribution page, and may be regenerated if Doxygen is installed.

The general features of Themis and a variety of validation tests will be described in a Themis code paper (under preparation).  In addition, Themis enabled publications should be included on the Publications page.


## Contributing

Please contribute!  Themis only works if many people participate in its development.  However, to ensure that Themis continues to be broadly accessible, we do have standards for code structure and documentation that can be found in detail on the Contributing page.
