This directory contains various utility functions used in Themis.
Additional utility functions should be added here.  Single, broadly
useful functions should be added to the "Themis::utils" namespace,
defined in utils.h and utils.cpp.  Additional utility objects should
be added as separate files (e.g., random_number_generator.h,cpp).
