Provides Vacuum Ray Tracing and Radiative Transfer (VRT2) library.
See INSTALL for installation instructions (make; make install).
Currently only local installations are supported.

To use VRT2 functions, include vrt2.h and link to libvrt2.a, i.e., an
implementation file, f.cpp, might look like:

#include "vrt2.h"

void func()
{
  VRT2::Kerr g(1,0.5);
}

which can be compiled via

> g++ -I.../vrt2/include -L.../vrt2/lib f.cpp -lvrt2
