This directory contains drivers of the key validation tests of Themis.
These can be made via:

 $ make validation

These are longer-timescale tests used to demonstrate that Themis functions
properly and provides results consistent with those that have been 
published, where appropriate.  This directer should grow only very slowly,
asymptoting to a fixed state as Themis development proceeds beyond
reproducing prior analysis projects.
